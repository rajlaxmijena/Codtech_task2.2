Project: Deep learning Project

Deep Learning Project involves building and training neural networks to solve complex problems like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and time-series forecasting.

Key Steps: Problem Definition: Identify the task (e.g., classification, regression, generation). Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather and clean data (e.g., images, text). Model Selection: Choose a neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Training: Feed data into the model, adjust weights using backpropagation and an optimizer (e.g., Adam). Evaluation: Test the model on unseen data using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, etc. Deployment: Deploy the model to production using a framework like TensorFlow Serving. Example Project: Task: Image classification Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Dataset: CIFAR-10 Metric: Accuracy Benefits: ✅ Handles large datasets and complex patterns ✅ High accuracy on unstructured data ✅ Supports parallel processing
